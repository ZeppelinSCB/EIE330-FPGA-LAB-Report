# Lab 3

In these experiments, students are required to practice implementing the finite state machine in FPGA.

## 3-1. Simple Vending Machine

Implement a vending machine. This vending machine sell cokes. You can only put one 1-yuan coin into the Coke machine at a time, and each bottle of Coke sells for 3 yuan, that is, you can make the Coke machine dispense Coke by putting in 3 coins. If you don't have enough coins and want to give up putting in coins, you need to press the reset button, otherwise the money you put in before cannot be returned.
