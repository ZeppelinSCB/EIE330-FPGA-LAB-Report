# Lab 5

In this experiment, students are required to learn how to create RAM IP core in Quartus, and learn how to solve the key jitter problem. 

## 5-1. How to create single-port RAM IP core

Using the single-port RAM as an example, show how to create the RAM IP core.

## 5-2. Key debounce

Use the Verilog HDL to implement a module for the key debounce. 

## 5-3. How to create single-port ROM IP core

Using the single-port ROM as an example, show how to create the ROM IP core.

## 5-4. VGA Display with ROM

Write a VGA driver and use the FPGA development board to drive the VGA display to the MUST logo with ten-color equal-width color bars as the background. The VGA display mode is 640x480@60. The expected experimental result is the following figure.
