# Lab 5

In this experiment, students are required to learn how to create RAM IP core in Quartus, and learn how to solve the key jitter problem. 

## 5-1. How to create single-port RAM IP core

Using the single-port RAM as an example, show how to create the RAM IP core.

## 5-2. Key debounce

Use the Verilog HDL to implement a module for the key debounce.
