  + 1-2. 2-to-1 Multiplexer
  + 1-3. 3-8 Line Decoder
  + 1-4. Half Adder
+ Lab 2:
  + 2-1. Top-Down Design
  + 2-2. Avoid Latch
  + 2-3. Flip-Flop
+ Lab 3: 
  + 3-1. Simple Finite State Machine
+ Lab 4:
  + 4-1. PLL IP Core
  + 4-2. VGA Display
+ Lab 5:
  + 5-1. RAM IP Core
  + 5-2. Key Debounce
  + 5-3. ROM IP Core
  + 5-4. VGA with ROM

Note: Codes that students are required to implement by themselves are not included in this repository.
