## Note for Collabrator
Notice that QuatusII Actucally Generate loads of files that no need to be followed. So remeber to add [this git ignore file](https://gist.github.com/nhasbun/71918796044b7ba89d6662133495f754) to the Quartus_prj directory where the .qpf file is found
<br />
If you want to versioning the output SOF/POF files, please redirecting the generated output to an own folder. To do this go to:
```
"Assignments"
  -> "Settings
  -> "Compilation Process Settings"
  -> "Save project output files in specified directory"
```
