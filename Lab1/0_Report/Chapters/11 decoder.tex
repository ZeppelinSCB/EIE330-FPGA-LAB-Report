\section{2-4 Line Decoder}
\subsection{Introduction}%Purpose, brief intro, Contribution
    \subsubsection{Background}
    A decoder can take n-th input lines and then decode them into 
    $2^n$ different output lines. 
    One application of such a component is to drive a display array with relatively
    narrow input lines.
    \subsubsection{Purpose}
    In this experiment, we want to design a 2-4 line decoder with an enabler 
    that can handle a two-bit input and decode them to light up 4 different LEDs.
    \subsubsection{Design and Key-results}
    The line decoder have one 2-bit input
