# Lab 1

These experiments are used to let students be familiar with softwares Quartus and Questa, practice writing Verilog HDL, and practice implementing the combinational logic.

## 1-1. Use a button to control one LED light

Use the given FPGA development board to implement a circuit that uses a button to control one LED light:
+ When the button is pressed, the light is on.
+ When the button is not pressed, the light is off.

## 1-2. 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Use the given FPGA development board to implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer. This multiplexer contains
+ 2 buttons as 2 individual inputs;
+ 1 button as the selection input;
+ 1 LED as the output.

## 1-3. 3-8 Line Decoder

Use the given FPGA development board to implement a 3-8 line decider. This decoder contains
+ 3 individual inputs: 3 inputs denote 3 bits of the natural binary number.
+ 8 outputs: One bit is high, which is determined by the input binary number. Other bits are low. The lowest bit denotes 0.

## 1-4. Half Adder

Use the given FPGA development board to implement a half adder. This half adder contains
+ 2 buttons as 2 individual inputs;
+ 1 LED as the carry-on bit output;
+ 1 LED as the sum bit output
