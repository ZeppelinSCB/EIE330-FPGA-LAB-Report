# Lab 4

In these experiments, students are required to learn how to create PLL IP core in Quartus, and practice deisgning systems based on the given datasheet.

## 4-1. How to create and use PLL IP core in Quartus 

Create and test PLL IP core in Quartus.

## 4-2. Simple VGA display

Write a VGA driver and use the FPGA development board to drive the VGA display to display ten-color equal-width color bars. The VGA display mode is 640x480@60. The expected experimental result is the following figure.
